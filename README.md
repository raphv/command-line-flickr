# Command-line Flickr

An old project (2009). Surprisingly, it's still working as of 2016.

This project was created as coursework for a "UI History" module and combines a web 2.0 service with an outdated type of user interface, in that case a command-line.

Although Flickr has been displaced by app-driven services like Instagram, it was then seen as a perfect example of the combination of an API, a web-based platform and a service supporting sharing and collaboration that makes "Web 2.0".

This is also a tribute to bulletin board services (BBS), the Minitel and other systems that remind us that computer networks haven't waited for graphical user interfaces (GUI) to become social.
